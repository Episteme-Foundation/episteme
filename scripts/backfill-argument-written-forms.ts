/**
 * Backfill for issue #129: named arguments created before write_argument
 * existed have their label copied into `content` instead of a written form
 * (brief prose with inline [[claim:<uuid>]] references stating how the
 * subclaims combine to bear on the claim).
 *
 * Rather than composing prose here, this re-enqueues each affected claim's
 * Steward — the prompt now instructs it to write the missing written forms
 * (and it owns the claim, so it can also fix stale grouping while it's there).
 * Detection matches hasWrittenForm(): content with no [[claim: links is a
 * label, not a written form.
 *
 * Safe by default: prints what it WOULD enqueue and exits. Pass `--confirm`
 * to actually enqueue. Re-driving stewards costs real model spend — run it
 * deliberately, ideally after the write_argument deploy has settled.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-argument-written-forms.ts            # dry run
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-argument-written-forms.ts --confirm  # apply
