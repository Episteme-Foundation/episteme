/**
 * One-shot recovery for claims parked as `steward_state='error'` by a TRANSIENT
 * failure (#97). The late-June credit-balance outage parked 81 of 142 production
 * claims as `error`; the pipeline now requeues transient failures automatically,
 * but claims parked BEFORE that fix landed still need a manual reset.
 *
 * This resets matching `error` claims back to `pending` (clearing the error and
 * the attempt counter) so the drain re-drives them. It does NOT touch claims
 * whose error looks like a genuine logic failure.
 *
 * Safe by default: prints what it WOULD reset and exits. Pass `--confirm` to
 * actually write. Re-driving costs real model spend and (until #98's stop-rule
 * fix is deployed) may regenerate over-decomposed trees — run it deliberately.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/recover-parked-stewards.ts            # dry run
 *   npx tsx scripts/recover-parked-stewards.ts --confirm  # apply
