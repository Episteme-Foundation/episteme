/**
 * Backfill for issue #173: named arguments created before evaluate_argument
 * existed carry no evaluation (whether the inference goes through granting
 * its premises, and which premises bear the weight).
 *
 * Rather than composing evaluations here, this re-enqueues each affected
 * claim's Steward — the prompt instructs it to evaluate every named argument
 * against the current premise assessments (and it owns the claim, so it can
 * also refresh anything else that is stale while it's there). Detection: a
 * named argument on an active claim with no is_current row in
 * argument_evaluations.
 *
 * Safe by default: prints what it WOULD enqueue and exits. Pass `--confirm`
 * to actually enqueue. Re-driving stewards costs real model spend — run it
 * deliberately, after the evaluate_argument deploy has settled.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-argument-evaluations.ts            # dry run
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-argument-evaluations.ts --confirm  # apply
